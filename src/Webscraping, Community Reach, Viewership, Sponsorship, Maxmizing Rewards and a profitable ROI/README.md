we perform competitor analysis on the available event management platforms such as LUMA, Cvent, Eventbrite APIs, phidata

we use literature study and conduct reviews on those platforms to understand what could be made better

and currently no event management platforms can efficiently handle virtual translations & transcripts in online meetings

so we deployed that


and for webscraping reasons, instead of relying on traditional webscrapers such as crawl4ai, puppeteer, selenium, beautiful soup, scrapy

we automate the scraping process using n8n, crew ai, pipedream and make, to automate manual webscraping

reason for webscraping:
-

we webscrap the linkedin with keywords such as key marketers, infleuncers and identify influential people with a better follower reach and we reach out to them for community driven engagement leads

we can ask them to market a particular event, for better reach and better event turnovers, ensuring success of an event with profitable ROI (return on investment0 metrics, with a dynamic pricing model, to increase the profits from consumer reach, based on turnovers & trend analysis, calculating a prediction model to assess the turnover/pull strength of a speaker to get the no. of people turning over.


we also handle social media advertisments, user menu driven event updates, adding event details, with prior authentication
