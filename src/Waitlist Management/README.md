We deployed priority scheduling algorithms such as FCFS, SJF, Priority scheduling, shortest booking time first, round robin, page replacement algorithms and optimize the results

we also provide them with shortest path to the event venues deploying gmaps & places API

we deal with shortest path graph traversalm algorithms such as A*, Dijkstra, RRT, RRT*, BFS, DFS, KRUSKAL, MST, PRIMS, BELLMAN FORD, FLOYD WARSHALL, FORD FULKERSON, Page algorithms
