            "         \"I’m a resident of Kannappa Nagar, Thiruvanmiyur. I got locked out of my apartment (4th floor) and efforts to break open the door was turning futile. I contacted the Thiruvanmiyur fire station for help and they were quick to respond with a team along with the fire engine. Though their services could not be used as the door gave way just as they arrived. I was deeply impressed at the quick response and their concern for  my safety and they left after an assurance that all was well and fine. I wish to express my gratitude and thanks to the Station master Mr. Shanmugham & his entire team.🙏\"\n",
